Once upon a time there was a marshmallow named Puff. Puff's hometown, named Gobbeville, was full of sweet and sugary treats, all except for chocolate. 
No, chocolate could not even be mentioned in Gobbeville. There has been a long lasting fued with chocolate, every since the time of Puff's grandparents. 
This marshmallow was sweet and gentle, but Puff could always get you into a sticky situation. Because of this, many people in Puff's hometown look down 
upon him. They said he was too "artificial" and never gave him a chance to prove himself. Well Puff was going to change all of that today. He had grown 
sick and tired of the way that his peers had chewed him out, so he decided to prove them all wrong in the most glorious way: reuniting chocolate with the 
sugary treats in Gobbeville. This journey would not be easy, but Puff knew this would prove to everyone that Puff is the real deal.
